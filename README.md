# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis using Python 🐍

Hi, I'm Jaswanth 👋  
This repository contains **12 essential EDA programs** written in Python to help beginners understand key concepts in **statistics, data visualization, and regression analysis**.

These programs are written in the **simplest way possible**, so even if you're just getting started, you'll understand what’s going on. Also, wherever possible, I’ve explained the logic and added comments in the code to make it easier to follow.

## 📁 What's Inside?

Each `.py` file corresponds to one statistical or data analysis concept:

| Program No. | Concept Covered                       | File Name         |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1           | Correlation & P-Values                 | `prog1.py`        |
| 2           | Scatterplots                           | `prog2.py`        |
| 3           | Linear Regression                      | `prog3.py`        |
| 4           | T-Test (Independent)                   | `prog4.py`        |
| 5           | Categorical Features (Value Counts)    | `prog5.py`        |
| 6           | Multiple Linear Regression with Dummies| `prog6.py`        |
| 7           | OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)           | `prog7.py`        |
| 8           | Univariate Analysis (Numeric)          | `prog8.py`        |
| 9           | Bivariate Statistics                   | `prog9.py`        |
| 10          | Multivariate Analysis                  | `prog10.py`       |
| 11          | Univariate Analysis (Categorical)      | `prog11.py`       |
| 12          | One-Way ANOVA                          | `prog12.py`       |
